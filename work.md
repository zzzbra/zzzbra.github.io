        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Assignment</h6>
        <p class="project-text">In advance of Beth Ditto’s plus-size fashion label launch, write a brand book that articulates the vision, mission, and values that shaped the new collection.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">The Challenge</h6>

        <p class="project-text">In 2009, Beth lent her name to a “cheap & chic” plus-size fashion line for Evans, the U.K.-based plus-sized retailer. This time around she is in complete creative control of her eponymous clothing line. Sold at a much higher price point, the new Beth Ditto collection needed smart branding to distinguish itself from the fast fashion typically sold to plus-size women. How do you brand a celebrity fashion label without “celebritizing” it?</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Strategy</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Marc Jacobs muse. LGBQT activist. Gossip’s frontwoman. Beth Ditto’s personal brand as punk “It girl” is well-known.  I wrote a lyrical origin story connecting Beth’s sartorial strategy to her punk sensibility, DIY mindset, and fat activism. The new Beth Ditto anthem: Move freely through the world in fabrics worthy of your body.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Assignment</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Create an influencer strategy that repositions a 15 year-old brand to appeal to a younger demographic: creative women, 25-35 years old living in coastal cities.</p> 

        <h6 class="project-subheader">The Challenge</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Known to buyers as a “soccer mom” brand and largely unknown to women under 50, Wilt needed a new story to accompany its new eCommerce site.  The social strategy and new brand positioning needed to support international growth without alienating existing brand loyalists. How do you evolve a brand without changing its character?</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Strategy</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Inspired by the Anne Carson quote “Perfection is less interesting” and the Japanese aesthetic wabi sabi, my new branding concept celebrates the beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete.</p>  

        <h6 class="project-subheader">Social Strategy Approach</h6>
        <p class="project-text">I created an influencer campaign called Work In Progress (#WiltWIP).  The concept reinforces two ideas: 1) Wilt makes the clothes you wear to create and 2) We are heirs to our younger selves. A spin on affiliate marketing, every month Wilt selected two primary influencers to create an exclusive product that was made available for a limited-time on Wilt’s site. Cermacist Isabel Halley, Lee Tighlman, a recipe developer, and Kate Pugsley, an illustrator and painter all participated in the campaign.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Assignment</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Reposition brand to appeal to both younger women less familiar with the brand and older women who were their original brand enthusiasts.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">The Challenge</h6>
        <p class="project-text">With the launch of its all-natural fragrance and body care products in 2007, Lavanila anticipated the organic beauty movement as a “pioneer in natural technologies.” Although they were first to market with an all-natural fragrance, many mainstream brands have since gone “green” and “organic” has become the norm.  How do you reposition a pioneer beauty brand in a now saturated marketplace?</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Strategy</h6>
        <p class="project-text">I worked alongside a team of designers to evolve Lavanila’s brand positioning from natural and nourishing, to empowering, effective and healthy.</p>

        <p class="project-text">Write, develop the theme, provide art direction and manage the entire production process for MHA-NYC’s 2014 Annual Report and microsite.</p> 

        <h6 class="project-subheader">The Challenge</h6>
        <p class="project-text">MHA-NYC is a large non-profit mental health organization. Together with its subsidiary, Link2Health Solutions it provides services that reach more than one million people every year.  How do you communicate the mission and impact of an organization with such a sprawling mission?</p> 

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Strategy</h6>
        <p class="project-text">I engaged the people MHA-NYC serves in the telling of their own stories. As Rena Au, one of MHA-NYC’s parent advocates told me “families must be heard and understood.” In developing this report, I did just that: I interviewed over two dozen staffers, including adminstrators, program associates, the C-suite, and clients to find inspiration for and consensus around a theme that could unify the entire organization.</p>

        <p class="project-text">Create a public health detailing kit to raise awareness about a new program called CICBT.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Original Assignment</h6>
        <p class="project-text">I was originally asked to create a public health detailing kit: patient education materials designed to promote cognitive behavioral therapy.  However, I persuaded the organization to increase my budget and the scope of my project.</p> 

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My New Assignment</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Develop a brand for the platform; work alongside a dev and design agency to create a consumer-friendly online portal and educational site; write all website copy and corresponding collateral; and, provide recommendations for an on-the-ground outreach strategy.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">The Challenge</h6>
        <p class="project-text">In 2014, it was estimated that over 700,000 New Yorkers coping with emotional distress during the long-term recovery from the storm. In response, NYS OASAS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services gave MHA-NYC a grant to provide those most in need with access to evidence-based online cognitive-behavioral therapy programs. How do you use behavioral health techonogy to reach hard-to-reach, underserved populations?</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Strategy</h6>
        <p class="project-text">iHelp is an innovative, technology-driven behavioral health initiative.  I developed the brand based on the premise that we needed to start talking about mental health in a different way. With the rise in emoji popularity, emojis provided the perfect way to communicate iHelp’s value as self-help that works, anytime, anywhere.</p>

        <p class="project-text">Brand strategy and repositioning; constituency building.</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Assignment</h6>
        <p class="project-text">Repositione the company with a new mission and vision; create and manage a new team, and set and implement the strategic communications plan.</p> 

        <h6 class="project-subheader">The Challenge</h6>
        <p class="project-text">In 2012, I joined a very early version of TalkSession as a consultant.  Although the company had worked with an agency to develop strong brand assets, it didn’t have a viable mission, a vision, a competitive brand position or a go-to-market strategy. Most importantly, when I came on board, Talksession was a startup with no CTO and no technology. How do you brand a techstart up with no tech?</p>

        <h6 class="project-subheader">My Strategy</h6>
        <p class="project-text">First, reposition the company with a social mission: “TalkSession is dedicated to making quality mental healthcare affordable, accessible, and acceptable.” Then focus on building a network of all-star therapists in NYC. We recruited a peer-referred group of leading mental health professionals in NYC and branded them our TalkSession Specialists. On mission alone we were able to on-board specialists who were trained at top institutions including Harvard, Columbia, Cornell and NYU and have been published in medical journals, such as Journal of the American Medicine Association and the New England Journal of Medicine. The network also included experts who had served as department chairs or division chiefs at premier medical centers.</p> 

        <p class="project-text">Our social mission won us a 3-year strategic partnership with GE Healthymagination.</p>
