Iâ€™ve worked with Fortune 500 companies, large non-profits, and healthcare tech
and fashion startups.* Regardless of size or sector, I connect brands to ideas
bigger than the products and services they sell.

More specifically, I help companies find their voices; articulate their
visions; and, communicate why what they do matters.

*I'm also an Oxford comma advocate.
